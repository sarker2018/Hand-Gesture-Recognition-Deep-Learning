# Hand gesture recognition: deep learning

*  `app.py` script can be used to create your own training data. Place the app.py file in your directory and run the file. It will capture images from your device camera and store them in 6 different folder named as 
`['Rolling Hand Backward', 'Rolling Hand Forward', 'Stop', 'Swiping Left', 'Swiping Right', 'No Gesture' ]`

* Use the pre-trained model form the save_model folder with any of the given .ipynb scripts (set-up google colab environment in your drive)
* A primary overview of the realtime image classfification sample is shown in the pptx file.
* I would love to know if your accuracy is improved.
